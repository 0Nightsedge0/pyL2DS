							Final Year Project
						Layer 2 Prevention System
	
	This program is a python program using cisco's SPAN function to
	defend some local network attacks such as ARP spoofing, ICMP redirection...
	
	Also, it use scapy module for packet analysis.
	GUI use pyQt4 to build.
	Graph module to draw graph such as line graph, bar graph.
